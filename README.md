Repository for my CMM307 Advanced Artificial Intelligence Coursework.

It contains a Google Colab Notebook, the dataset used for the project and the research paper from which I implemented an algorithm.

## NOTES:
If you're using this notebook for the first time (or if you get errors like `ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed`), follow these steps:

1. Go to the `INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES` cell at the top.
2. Set `INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES = True`.
3. Run that cell to install the correct versions of packages.
4. **Restart the runtime** (Runtime > Restart runtime).
5. Set `INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES = False` again.
6. Run all cells from the top.
7. It should all run smoothly now.
